# SQL

Originally this was a repo I've created while I was working at [Spad](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spadcompany/) just to test operator precedence in Prisma. But then I decided it should be where I share my know-how in SQL and this lovely ORM called [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). But again I changed my mind and from now on it is gonna be place for my future SQL course.
